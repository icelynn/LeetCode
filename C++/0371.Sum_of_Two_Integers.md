> Description

* Calculate the sum of two integers *a* and *b*, but you are not allowed to use the operator ```+``` and ```-```.

## Example 1:
```
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
```
## Example 2:
```
Input: a = -2, b = 3
Output: 1
```

## Solutions
---
> Approach :
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getSum(int a, int b) {
        long long carry; // 64-bit
        while (b != 0) {
            carry = a & b;
            a = a ^ b;
            b = ((carry & 0xffffffff) << 1); // limited to 32 bits
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```
