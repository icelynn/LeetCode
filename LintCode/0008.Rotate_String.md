> Description

* Given a string(Given in the way of char array) and an offset, rotate the string by offset `in place`. (rotate from left to right)

###Note:
offset >= 0
the length of str >= 0

## Example 1:
```
Input: str="abcdefg", offset = 3
Output: str = "efgabcd"
Explanation: Note that it is rotated in place, that is, after str is rotated, it becomes "efgabcd".
```
## Example 2:
```
Input: str="abcdefg", offset = 0
Output: str = "abcdefg"
Explanation: Note that it is rotated in place, that is, after str is rotated, it becomes "abcdefg".
```
## Example 3:
```
Input: str="abcdefg", offset = 1
Output: str = "gabcdef"
Explanation: Note that it is rotated in place, that is, after str is rotated, it becomes "gabcdef".
```
## Example 4:
```
Input: str="abcdefg", offset =2
Output: str = "fgabcde"
Explanation: Note that it is rotated in place, that is, after str is rotated, it becomes "fgabcde".
```
## Example 5:
```
Input: str="abcdefg", offset = 10
Output: str = "efgabcd"
Explanation: Note that it is rotated in place, that is, after str is rotated, it becomes "efgabcd".
```



## Solutions
---
> Approach 1 : Split into two substrings
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @param str: An array of char
     * @param offset: An integer
     * @return: nothing
     */
    void rotateString(string &str, int offset)
    {
        if (str.length() == 1 || str.empty()) return;

        int off = offset % str.length();
        int n = str.length() - off;
        string sub1 = str.substr(0, n);
        string sub2 = str.substr(n, off);
        str = sub2 + sub1;
    }
};

```
#### Complexity Analysis
* Time complexity : $O(1)$.

* Space complexity : $O(1)$.

> Approach 2 : Reverse

First reverse head, then tail, finally the whole string.
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  /**
     * param A: A string
     * param offset: Rotate string with offset.
     * return: Rotated string.
     */
    string rotateString(string A, int offset) {
        if (A.empty() || A.size() == 0) {
            return A;
        }

        int len = A.size();
        offset %= len;
        reverse(A, 0, len - offset - 1);
        reverse(A, len - offset, len - 1);
        reverse(A, 0, len - 1);
        return A;
    }

private:
    void reverse(string &str, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            char temp = str[start];
            str[start] = str[end];
            str[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
};

```
#### Complexity Analysis
* Time complexity : $O(n)$.

* Space complexity : $O(1)$ or $O(n)$.
