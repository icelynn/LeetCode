> Description

* Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

## Example :
```
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
Output:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
```

## Note:
* All inputs will be in lowercase.
* The order of your output does not matter.

## Solutions

### Approach 1 : Categorize by Sorted String
### Intuition
Two strings are anagrams if and only if their sorted strings are equal.
### Algorithm
Maintain a map `ans : {String -> List}` where each key $K$ is a sorted string, and each value is the list of strings from the initial input that when sorted, are equal to $K$.

In Java, we will store the key as a string, eg. `code`. In Python, we will store the key as a hashable tuple, eg. ('c', 'o', 'd', 'e').
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs)
    {
        std::unordered_map<string, vector<string>> map;
        for (auto str : strs)
        {
            string key = str;
            std::sort(key.begin(), key.end());
            map[key].push_back(str);
        }
        vector<vector<string>> result;
        for (auto anagrams : map)
            result.push_back(anagrams.second);

        return result;
    }
};
```

#### Complexity Analysis
* Time complexity : $O(NKlogK)$ , where $N$ is the length of strs, and $K$ is the maximum length of a string in strs. The outer loop has complexity $O(N)$ as we iterate through each string. Then, we sort each string in $O(KlogK)$ time.

* Space complexity : $O(NK)$ , the total information content stored in `ans`.

### Approach 2 : Categorize by Count (Counting Sort)
### Intuition
Two strings are anagrams if and only if their character counts (respective number of occurrences of each character) are the same.
### Algorithm
We can transform each string s\text{s}s into a character count, count\text{count}count, consisting of 26 non-negative integers representing the number of $a$'s, $b$'s, $c$'s, etc. We use these counts as the basis for our hash map.

In Java, the hashable representation of our count will be a string delimited with '#' characters. For example, `abbccc` will be `#1#2#3#0#0#0...#0` where there are 26 entries total. In python, the representation will be a tuple of the counts. For example, `abbccc` will be `(1, 2, 3, 0, 0, ..., 0)`, where again there are 26 entries total.


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> groupAnagrams(vector<string>& strs) {
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> mp;
        for (string s : strs) {
            mp[countingSort(s)].push_back(s);
        }
        vector<vector<string>> anagrams;
        for (auto p : mp) {
            anagrams.push_back(p.second);
        }
        return anagrams;
    }
private:
    string countingSort(string s) {
        int counter[26] = {0};
        for (char c : s) {
            counter[c - 'a']++;
        }
        string t;
        for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
            t += string(counter[c], c + 'a');
        }
        return t;
    }
};
```
#### Complexity Analysis
* Time complexity : $O(NK)$ , where $N$ is the length of `strs`, and $K$ is the maximum length of a string in `strs`. Counting each string is linear in the size of the string, and we count every string.

* Space complexity : $O(NK)$ , the total information content stored in `ans`.
